            BB was founded in 2021 by two Lovers : Petter Makarov and Barbara
            Liguori . They saw firsthand how rewarding being a travel advisor
            could be.

            They also understood why more people didn't pursue a career as an
            advisor. The industry was antiquated, designed to keep newcomers
            out. So, they decided it was time for a change. Enter BB.
